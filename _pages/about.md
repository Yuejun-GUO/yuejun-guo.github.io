I am a Senior R&T Scientist at the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST)](https://www.list.lu/). My current research interests are trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), applied AI in cybersecurity and natural language processing (NLP). Particularly, in my pursuit of applied AI, I seek to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications. One critical aspect of my work involves ensuring the security and resilience of AI-powered applications.
