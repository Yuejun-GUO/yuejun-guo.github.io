I am an Senior R&T Scientist at the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST)](https://www.list.lu/). My current research interests are trustworthy machine learning (ML), applied ML in cybersecurity and natural language processing (NLP). Particularly, in my pursuit of applied ML, I seek to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications. One critical aspect of my work involves ensuring the security and resilience of ML-powered applications.
